1. There ought to be some kind of version control here
2. I want to make everything consistent:
- so many calculations have been inlined
- I used different formulas for the same thing, esp. brine volume
-> remove inlined formulas, stick in functions
-> try to have one, "canonical" version of each function, esp. things like brine
   volume and the different effective permittivity formulas,
-> if there is more than one version, should be clearly distinquished...
